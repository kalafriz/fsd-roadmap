# [Community Garden Homepage](https://kalafriz.github.io/fsd-roadmap/club-homepage/src/index.html) | HTML, CSS, Tailwind

### About:

(Abandoned, see notes) Static page for a fictional community garden club. Project focuses on CSS and Tailwind. Based on Chris Courses's [CSS Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqmB-Zj2-PA&ab_channel=ChrisCourses)

### Packages:

- Tailwind

### Notes:
- I found this tutorial to be ill-organized and overall encouraged a lot of poor practices: code redundancy, disorganized structure, etc. My biggest gripe with the course was the way relative/absolute positioning was handled for the hero-- it effectively encouraged positioning pixel-by-pixel, and really should have made the navbar the absolute-positioned element. I didn't follow through to the end of the tutorial where a 'stats' section is made, I didn't see much value in it.
