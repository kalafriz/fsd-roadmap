# [Fun Facts Page](https://kalafriz.github.io/fsd-roadmap/learn-react-scrimba/fun-facts/index.html) | JavaScript, React

### About:
 Static React page with some fun facts about me. Yay. Based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) via freeCodeCamp.org.

### Packages:
- React, ReactDOM, Babel

### Notes:
- This app uses CDNs to import React
- Have yet to configure React for GitHub pages for this, so page is not live.
