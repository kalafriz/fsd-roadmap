# [Geologist's Blog Page](https://kalafriz.github.io/fsd-roadmap/rock-blog/index.html) | HTML, CSS
### About:

Static page for a fictional geologist's blog. This project is a first attempt at creating a static 
webpage, without any tutorials or concrete reference. See notes for known bugs. Vanilla HTML and CSS.

### Packages:

- Sass

### Notes:
- Not mobile responsive. Probably will not implement in the future.
- All blog preview cards on `index.html` are hard-coded with HTML tables. In retrospect, this would be 
best done with flex or grid formatting, and obviously generated with React or likewise.
- Article copy generated with ChatGPT 3.5.
