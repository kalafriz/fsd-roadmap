 # [Basic Calculator App - iOS Style ](https://kalafriz.github.io/fsd-roadmap/calculator-app/index.html) | HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### About:
Basic calculator app, styled/cloned from the iOS calculator. Uses vanilla JavaScript. 

### Notes:
- This app evaluates and sets internal values as input is entered. Maintaining a stack didn't really seem necessary (and honestly still isn't) for this project, but I were to do it again, I'd go for an RPN based implementation just for cleaner code and obviously better ability to expand functionality.
- Did not implement active operator button styling, nor responsive number display sizing. May update in future.
- Functional difference: Clearing the result evaluated using the = button will set different values.
  - Example: Sequence 3, x, 4, = will result in displaying 12 on both. Continuing with C, 5, = results in 20 on iOS, and 60 on my app.
