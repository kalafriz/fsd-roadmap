# [Travel Journal App](https://kalafriz.github.io/fsd-roadmap/learn-react-scrimba/travel-journal/src/index.html) | React

### About:
 React app to log travel memories with images and text.

### Packages:
- React, Babel

### Notes:
- Added entry form in addition to project requirements. Some entry requirements for form data (i.e. end date) have been made optional for practicality. ([See requirements below](#requirements--reference))
- All input data is stored in local storage.
    - Images are converted to base64 to allow for this
    - Data array stored in `App.js` instead of separate file (as suggested by project requirements) to avoid bugs with importing/creating new instances of React hooks.
- Have yet to configure React for GitHub pages for this, so page is not live.
